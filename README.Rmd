This {[rui](https://rogiersbart.github.io/rui)} R package provides a wrapper
around different {[cli](https://cli.r-lib.org/)} and
{[usethis](https://usethis.r-lib.org/)} functions, aiming at providing a small
but consistent set of verbs to construct a simple R package UI.

The idea is that all of the verbs allow the use of
{[glue](https://glue.tidyverse.org/)} strings and {cli} styles,
to streamline coding with {rui}.

As of version v0.2.0, the `rui::console()` function provides an alternative API
to the verbs, which may be easier for frequent {rui} users, although the verbs
better communicate developer intent.

## Install

You can install the latest version of {rui} with the following:

``` r
if (!require(pak)) install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("rogiersbart/rui")
```

## Use

The {rui} verb API is used as follows:

```{r}
rui::tell("Standard text")
rui::entitle("Title a section")
rui::inform("Provide information")
rui::approve("Something seems to be fine")
rui::disapprove("Something seems to be wrong")
```

The `rui::console()` API allows the same to be achieved like this:

```{r}
rui::console("Standard text")
rui::console("# Title a section")
rui::console("i Provide information")
rui::console("v Something seems to be fine")
rui::console("x Something seems to be wrong")
```

In a console/terminal, colours of the prefixes further help to distinguish the
different kinds of messages. The above is just a subset of the functionality,
however, as we have 19 verbs implemented at the moment. For a more thorough
introduction, see `vignette("rui")`.
